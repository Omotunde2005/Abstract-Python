title: Response Object.
---

All responses are returned as a `JSON` object. Each response object has a `status` field that contains the response status code.

Below is a sample response object for a successful request:

```python

{
  // Other response data
  "status": 200
}
```

The `status` field is used to verify the request's success.See all status codes here:
