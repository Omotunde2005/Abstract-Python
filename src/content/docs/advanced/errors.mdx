title: Errors.

Errors in `abstract-python` are of two (2) types:

- **Regular Python exceptions:**

A common exception you will encounter is the `TypeError`, usually from wrong data types used in arguments.

- **JSON error messages:**

These are JSON objects with detailed description of the error. They are often self-explanatory.

Below is a sample error message:

```python
// Authorization error

{
  "error": {
    "message":"A validation error occurred.",
    "code":"validation_error",
    "details":{
      "api_key":["This field may not be blank."],
      "country_code":["\"fu\" is not a valid choice."]
    }
  },
  "status": 401
}
```
