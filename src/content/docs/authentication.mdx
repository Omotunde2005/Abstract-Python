## How to authenticate with an API key

Each API class in `abstract-python` requires an `api_key` to send queries. The key must belong to
the API you intend to use. Below is a snippet on how to use an api-key:

```python
from abstract_python import VatAPI

vat_api_key = "your_unique_vat_api_key"

vatapi = VatAPI(vat_api_key)
```

You can begin to call the methods available for the authenticated class.
