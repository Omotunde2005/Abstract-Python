The Exchange Rates API can be used to get real time exchange rates, past/historical rates, and perform quick currency conversion betwwen multiple currencies.
It supports over 80+ currencies. In `abstract-python`, the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class is used to communicate with this API.

## API endpoints

## Supported currency codes

AbstractAPI supports ISO 4217 currency codes which can be found [here](https://docs.abstractapi.com/exchange-rates#currency-codes-of-supported-currencies)

## Get currency codes programmatically

With `abstract-python` you can get the supported currency codes as a Python List. See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python import EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES

print(EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES)
```

Here is the result below:

```python
>>> [
    "ARS", "AUD", "BCH", "BGN", "BNB", "BRL", "BTC", "CAD", "CHF", "CNY",
    "CYP", "CZK", "DKK", "DOGE", "DZD", "EEK", "ETH", "EUR", "GBP", "GRD",
    "HKD", "HRK", "HUF", "IDR", "ILS", "INR", "ISK", "JPY", "KRW", "LTC",
    "LTL", "LVL", "MAD", "MTL", "MXN", "MYR", "NOK", "NZD", "PHP", "PLN",
    "RON", "RUB", "SEK", "SGD", "SIT", "SKK", "THB", "TRY", "TWD", "USD",
    "XRP", "ZAR"
    ]
```

### Use case

If your app receives currency codes from users, you may need to validate these inputs before querying the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class.

See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python import EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES

base_currency = input("Enter a currency code")

if base_currency in EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES:
    # continue with the app logic
else:
    print(f"{base_currency} is not a supported currency code")
```

The code above is a simple console-based program. This technique can also be extended to other programs such as a web app or desktop app.

## Error messages

Refer to [this page](https://docs.abstractapi.com/exchange-rates#response-and-error-codes) for all possible error messages you may encounter while using the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class.
