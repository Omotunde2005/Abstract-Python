import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## How to use the library

If your app requires two or more of the supported APIs, it's recommended to import the entire library as seen below:

```python
from abstract_python import *

vatAPI = VatAPI()
```

<Aside>The example above uses the helper class for the VAT API.</Aside>

Use the following format for single API usage:

```python
from abstract_python import VatAPI

vatAPI = VatAPI()
```
