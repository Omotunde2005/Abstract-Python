This endpoint allows you to calculate VAT on the prices of goods in a particular country.

The `VatAPI.calculate()` method is used to communicate with this endpoint.

## Method parameters

Below are the parameters for this method:

- **amount (String) \*required:** The amount that you would like to get the VAT amount for or from.

  - **For**: That is, vat is not included in the price and you want to add it.
  - **From**: That is, vat is already included in the price and you want to extract it

- **country_code (String) \*required:** The two letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country in which the transaction takes place.

- **is_vat_incl (Boolean):** Used to declare if vat fee has already been included in the amount. If the amount already has VAT added, set this to True. The response data will split out the amount and VAT.
  If this parameter is not set, it will default to false.

- **vat_category (String):** Some countries offer a reduced VAT rate for certain categories of goods. To determine if a reduced VAT is available and to apply it to the final amount, include the vat_category in the request.

## Usage

Below is a code snippet that uses the `VatAPI.calculate()` method:

```python
from abstract_python import VatAPI

api_key = "your-vat-api-key"

api = VatAPI(api_key)
amount = "50"
country_code = "BE"
response = api.calculate(amount, country_code)

print(response)

```

Below is the response object:

```
{
    'amount_excluding_vat': '50.00',
    'amount_including_vat': '60.50',
    'vat_amount': '10.50',
    'vat_category': 'standard',
    'vat_rate': '0.210',
    'country': {
        'code': 'BE',
        'name': 'Belgium'
    },
    'status': 200
}
```

## Using optional arguments

Below is a code snippet that uses optional arguments in the `VatAPI.calculate()` method:

```python
from abstract_python import VatAPI

api_key = "your-vat-api-key"

api = VatAPI(api_key)
amount = "50"
country_code = "BE"
is_vat_incl = True
vat_category = "standard"
response = api.calculate(amount, country_code)

print(response)

```

Below is the response object:

```
{
    'amount_excluding_vat': '50.00',
    'amount_including_vat': '60.50',
    'vat_amount': '10.50',
    'vat_category': 'standard',
    'vat_rate': '0.210',
    'country': {
        'code': 'BE',
