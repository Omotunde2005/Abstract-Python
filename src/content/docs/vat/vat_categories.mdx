## Method parameters

- **country_code (String) \*required:** The two letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the country in which the transaction was recorded.

## Usage

Below is a code snippet that uses the `VatAPI.categories()` method:

```python
from abstract_python import VatAPI

api_key = "your-vat-api-key"

api = VatAPI(api_key)

response = api.categories(country_code)

print(response)
