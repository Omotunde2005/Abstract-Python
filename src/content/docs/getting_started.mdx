The `abstract-python` library is a Python SDK for APIs by [AbstractAPI](https://www.abstractapi.com/). It has helper classes
that enable Python developers use these APIs without having to know the endpoints off-hand.

It also does type validation on each request data before they're sent to the API server. This helps to manage credits, as each request costs a credit -
whether successful or otherwise.

This SDK currrently supports the **[Exchange Rates API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/exchange-rates)**,
**[IP Geolocation API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation)**, and the **[VAT API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/vat-validation)**.

<Aside>
  This isn't an official SDK by AbstractAPI but safe to use by anyone.
